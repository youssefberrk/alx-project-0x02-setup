# Next.js Project Setup and Basics

We will break down the structure of an Airbnb clone project set up using `create-next-app` with TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS. This project is designed without the `src` directory, App Router, and uses custom aliasing for cleaner imports. Letâ€™s explore each component, folder, and file to understand their roles within the project.

## Project Setup
To initialize the project, we use the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest airbnb-clone --typescript --eslint --tailwind
```

Choose the following options:
- `src` directory: No  
- App Router: No  
- Customize the default import alias: Yes (use `@/*` for simpler imports)

This command scaffolds a Next.js project with TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS, creating a solid foundation for our Airbnb clone.

## Project Structure Overview
The project is divided into several folders and files, each serving a specific purpose:

### 1. Root Directory
The root directory contains essential files and folders required to run the project:
- `pages/`: Houses all page components. Each file within this directory corresponds to a route in the application.
- `components/`: Contains reusable components used across various pages.
- `public/`: Stores static files like images and icons.
- `styles/`: Manages global and component-specific styling with Tailwind CSS.
- `utils/`: Contains helper functions that simplify tasks like API calls and data formatting.
- `hooks/`: Custom React hooks for managing state and reusing logic.
- `context/`: Global state management through React context providers.
- `assets/`: Additional static assets, such as fonts or SVG icons.

### 2. Key Folders and Their Roles

#### `pages/`
**Purpose:** Defines the main pages of the application.  
**Files:**
- `index.tsx`: Home - Listing Page displaying all available properties.
- `[slug].tsx`: Dynamic route for the Detail Page, providing information on a selected listing.
- `checkout.tsx`: Checkout Page where users can review and confirm bookings.

#### `components/`
**Purpose:** Contains modular, reusable components that help build the UI.  
**Components:**
- `ListingCard.tsx`: Displays property information on the Home Page.
- `Navbar.tsx` & `Footer.tsx`: Layout components used for navigation and footer content on every page.
- `DetailView.tsx`: Presents detailed information about a specific property.
- `CheckoutForm.tsx`: Form component handling checkout details.
- `ImageGallery.tsx`: A gallery for displaying images in the Detail Page.
- `ReviewSection.tsx`: Lists reviews on the Detail Page.

#### `styles/`
**Purpose:** Manages CSS, utilizing Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.  
**Files:**
- `globals.css`: Global styles and Tailwind CSS configuration.
- `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`: Configuration files for Tailwind CSS.

#### `utils/`
**Purpose:** Holds utility functions for reusable logic.  
**Files:**
- `apiClient.ts`: Configurations and functions for API calls.
- `formatPrice.ts`: Formats currency for price display.

#### `hooks/`
**Purpose:** Contains custom hooks to manage specific logic.  
**Files:**
- `useListings.ts`: Manages data fetching for property listings.
- `useCart.ts`: Manages state for items added to the cart.

#### `context/`
**Purpose:** Global state management using React Context API.  
**Files:**
- `CartContext.tsx`: Provides a context for managing the cart globally.
- `UserContext.tsx`: Handles user authentication and state.

### 3. Essential Configuration Files

#### `tsconfig.json`
**Purpose:** TypeScript configuration file for managing paths and aliases.  
**Example Aliases:**
```json
"paths": {
  "@/components/*": ["components/*"],
  "@/hooks/*": ["hooks/*"],
  "@/utils/*": ["utils/*"],
  "@/context/*": ["context/*"],
  "@/assets/*": ["assets/*"]
}
```

#### `tailwind.config.js` & `postcss.config.js`
**Purpose:** Configures Tailwind CSS for styling and sets up PostCSS for processing CSS.
